========================================
Make --- Automated Documentation Builder
========================================

.. currentmodule:: default_profile.sphinxext.make

While still being actively worked on, the ideal usage would begin with the user
in the `<../docs>`_ directory of the repository and running.:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 sphinx_extensions/make html

Where *html* can be replaced with one of *html*, *singlehtml*, *doctest* or
*linkcheck*. Not all :command:`sphinx-build` options are currently supported.

Moving output files
-------------------

>>> import shutil
>>> from os.path import join as pjoin
>>> import subprocess
>>> BUILD_DIR = pjoin('build', 'html')
>>> if shutil.which('rsync'):
>>>     subprocess.run(['rsync', '-hv8r', BUILD_DIR, '.'])

You could even add one of the *delete on destination* options that rsync has.

One of them specifies to delete anything at the destination not in source.
Obviously be careful beforehand but that could be a really simple way to
automatically keep the documentation fresh.
