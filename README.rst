============
IPython
============

This repository contains a collection of different scripts written over the
course of the last year modifying IPython.

The intent was to create a system that worked on any relatively modern platform.

Therefore, any script should work on:

- Ubuntu
- Android
- Windows 10

On Windows 10, the scripts have been primarily tested in powershell windows or Conemu.
As a result, there may be unexpected behavior that arises in :command`cmd`.

In addition, the scripts therein make a few assumptions. One is that the repository
at `<https://github.com/farisachugthai/Gruvbox-IPython>`_ has been installed.

Another would be that the user wants to use Nvim as their default editor.

However, these are minor details are can be configured with relatively little effort.

As a matter of fact, this README is currently being written from within Emacs.
